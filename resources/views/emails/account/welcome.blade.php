Hello {{ $user->name }},
<br>
<br>
I'm Mike, the creator of bemail and I'd like to just take a second to introduce myself and say thanks for creating an account with us.
<br>
<br>
I created bemail because I found that I had a lot of difficulty communicating with international customers, suppliers and even remote team members. I was starting to spend way too much time translating emails back and forth and work was piling up. So I looked to online translation market places and they were expensive as heck. With the amount of emails I was sending, there was no way my boss would've approved it. But I was sure with a different business model and more efficient platform we could lower translation prices for emails - and I was right! 16 months later, bemail is handling up to tens of thousands of messages a day at some of the most competitive rates but most importantly has brought a little joy back to work for hundreds of professionals. So I hope our service helps you out a little too and that you enjoy using it as much as we did building it.
<br>
<br>
If you run into any issues, have any questions, or suggestions, please do let us know at team@bemail.io. We're always grateful for any feedback to help us improve our service.
<br>
<br>
Best,
<br>
Mike W.
