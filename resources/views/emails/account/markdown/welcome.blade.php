## Hello {{ $user->name }},

I'm Mike, the creator of bemail and I'd like to just take second to say thanks for creating an account with us and briefly explain our service.

We use to have a lot of difficulty communicating with our international customers, suppliers and various agents. Our company wasn't big enough to hire dedicated translators either, so we looked to online translators. It turns out those were pretty good for professional or bulk text translations but way too expensive for short messages (like the ones we were sending). The translation quality and tone were inconsistent from translator to translator, too. And at the end of it, we still had to go back and manually copy-paste-send the emails out.

bemail was created to address all those problems by making translated emails quick, easy and actually affordable.

If you run into any issues, have any questions, or suggestions, please do let us know at <a href="mailto:team@bemail.io">team@bemail.io</a>. We're always grateful for any feedback to help us improve our service.

Mike Wu (<a href="mailto:mike@bemail.io">mike@bemail.io</a>)
